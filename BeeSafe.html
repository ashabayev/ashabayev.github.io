            <p>Designed and developed a new AR book called Bee Safe for DisruptED's app while communicating directly with the client. 
            This Augmented Reality book is accessible with both Android and iOS and uses different AR techniques than the other books in the app. </p>
                
            <p>When designing this AR book, I didn't want to be constrained to the idea that AR is limited to just placing 
                3D objects on a tracked image. I wanted to include multiple ways that kids can interact with the book. And so each 
                page of the book has different ways to interact with it. One page encouraged kids to use the phone as a 
                viewfinder to find virus cells floating around them and to destroy the cells by spraying disinfectant solution
                on them. Another game in the book was a drawing minigame that allows kids to draw in 3D space and interact with
                the real world as they haven't before, by being able to drawing a 3D dinosaur on their dinner room table, 
                drawing a maze through their house, or by drawing a funny hat on someone. I wanted to create games that
                encouraged kids to be active and to look at their surroundings from a different perspective. </p>
            <!--<p>One problem I see with Augmented Reality in the industry currently, is the idea that it can only be used to place a 3D model
                on an image target or flat plane. Sure that is novel for many people and can be engaging to see a life size 
                model of something that you wouldn't be able to see in person otherwise, such as how New York Times created 
                an AR article to see sports professionals in your home, or how searching 'wolf' in google allows you to place 
                a life size timber wolf. However, the technology is much further on then that and our design decisions are 
                being limited thinking that we can only place 3D models. I think that one of the most important things about 
                AR is how it interacts with the real world. Not just having a virtual object layered over the real world.</p>-->
